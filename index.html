            <h1>Mary W. Jackson</h1>
            <h2>
                NASA Engineer, Mathematician, Mother<br>
                1921 - 2005 
            </h2>
            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>Mary Jackson (née Winston) was born on April 9, 1921 and died on February 11, 2005. <br><br> Mary was an American mathematician and aerospace engineer at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), which in 1958 was succeeded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). <br><br>She worked at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, for most of her career. She started as a computer at the segregated West Area Computing division in 1951. She took advanced engineering classes and, in 1958, became NASA's <em>first</em> black female engineer.</p>

            <h3>Early career</h3>
            <p>Mary’s path to an engineering career at the NASA Langley Research Center was far from direct. A native of Hampton, Virginia, she graduated from Hampton Institute in 1942 with a dual degree in Math and Physical Sciences, and became a maths teacher at a black school in Calvert County, Maryland.</p>
            <p>Hampton had become one of the nerve centres of the World War II home front effort, and after a year of teaching, Mary returned home, finding a position as the receptionist at the King Street USO Club, which served the city’s black population. It would take three more career changes — a post as a bookkeeper in Hampton Institute’s Health Department, a stint at home following the birth of her son, Levi, and a job as an Army secretary at Fort Monroe — before Mary landed at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory’s segregated West Area Computing section in 1951, reporting to the group’s supervisor <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/dorothy-vaughan-biography" target="_blank">Dorothy Vaughan.</a></p>
            <h3>Pioneer to engineer</h3>
            <blockquote><b>Karl Zielinski</b>: Let me ask you, if you were a white male, would you wish to be an engineer?<br><br><b>Mary Jackson</b>: I wouldn't have to. I'd already be one. <br><br> - taken from <i>Hidden Figures</i> movie, 2016</blockquote>
            <p>After two years in the computing pool, Mary received an offer to work for engineer Kazimierz Czarnecki in the 4-foot by 4-foot Supersonic Pressure Tunnel, a 60,000 horsepower wind tunnel capable of blasting models with winds approaching twice the speed of sound. Czarnecki eventually suggested she enter a training program that would allow her to be promoted from mathematician to engineer.</p>
            <p>As classes were held at then-segregated Hampton High School, Mary needed special permission from the City of Hampton to join her white peers in the classroom.<br><br>Never one to flinch in the face of a challenge, Mary completed the graduate level math and physics courses, earned the promotion, and in 1958 <strong>became NASA’s first black female engineer.</strong> That same year, she co-authored her first report, Effects of Nose Angle and Mach Number on Transition on Cones at Supersonic Speeds.</p>

            <h3>Hitting the glass ceiling</h3>
            <p>Mary began her engineering career in an era in which female engineers of <i>any</i> background were a rarity; in the 1950s, it was likely she was the only black female aeronautical engineer in the field.</p>
            <p>For nearly two decades she enjoyed a productive engineering career, authoring or co-authoring a dozen or so research reports, most focused on the behaviour of the boundary layer of air around airplanes.</p>
            <p>As the years progressed, the promotions slowed, and she became frustrated at her inability to break through the glass ceiling into management-level grades. In 1979, she left engineering, taking a demotion to fill the position of Langley’s Federal Women’s Program Manager.</p>
            <p>Engineering's loss was the next generation's gain. There, she worked hard to impact the hiring and promotion of the next generation of all of NASA’s female mathematicians, engineers and scientists.</p>
            <h3>Life after NASA</h3>
            <p>Mary retired from Langley in 1985. Among her many honors were an Apollo Group Achievement Award, and being named Langley’s Volunteer of the Year in 1976. She served as the chair of one of the centre’s annual United Way campaigns, was a Girl Scout troop leader for more than three decades, and a member of the National Technical Association (the oldest African American technical organisation in the United States). She and her husband Levi had an open-door policy for young Langley recruits trying to gain their footing in a new town and a new career.</p>
            <blockquote><i>“We have to do something...to get [kids] interested in science...Sometimes they are not aware of the number of black scientists, and don't even know of the career opportunities until it is too late."</i> - Mary Jackson speaking to a local newspaper about a science club she set up for youngsters at Hampton’s King Street Community centre in the 1970s</blockquote>
            <h3>Hidden Figures</h3>
            <p>Jackson's story features in the 2016 non-fiction book <i>Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Who Helped Win the Space Race</i>. She is one of the three protagonists in <i>Hidden Figures</i>, played by creative polymath Janelle Monáe, the film adaptation released in the same year. You can watch the <i>Hidden Figures</i> trailer below.</p>
            <p>In 2019, Jackson was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal and in 2021, the Washington, D.C. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-names-headquarters-after-hidden-figure-mary-w-jackson" target="_blank">headquarters of NASA was renamed the Mary W. Jackson NASA Headquarters.</a></p>
